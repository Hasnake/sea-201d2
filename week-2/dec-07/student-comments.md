## Student comments from Week 1

### Helpful...

1- I really love how teacher and TAs helped students one by one to understand the concepts. 2- There is class schedule on gitHub, etc. 3- They are always available ( online on slack, etc)

It would help it the lectures were before labs.

...provided the exact same copy on github for us to download and that way, we could open it in atom and then use google's console log to do exactly what he did on the screen

Having instant access to the teachers and TAs helped with getting my questions answered, whether they were concrete or conceptual. On a few occasions, I was approached by a teacher/TA before I approached them, and this was even better.

The most appreciated element in class is the ratio of TA's to students, 4 to 1. I never have to wait long for a question to be answered.

### Least Helpful...

I would love to have access to upcoming assignments before the lecture. Because a lot of this is review for me at the moment, it would help me structure my personal challenges better if I new what kind of functionality we would be adding to our projects on subsequent days.

Sometimes I think it makes it really hard when we dont have examples or step to step instructions on how to do assignments. But I do understand the concept of trying to figure it out on our own and really understanding the material. Which makes sense. But examples are the best way for me to see how something is used.

Code review for style purposes

I would rather have lecture in the morning and then have the opportunity to have lab afterward so that I could apply the new knowledge, and reinforce the concepts more immediately.

I feel the pace of it is least helpful. It is a lot to take in at once which was clearly exposed in the beginning, but at times I feel like it would be nice to have just a one day breather so we have a chance to just thoroughly look back and re-digest what we have learned.

## Questions, Suggestions, Concerns...

It would be more helpful if the labs were after lectures. Doing it like this - i spend more time working on the assignments/after lectures and during labs. Personally, I learn by putting things what I just read into practice and trying to connect that. Having that slow start in the morning, waiting for your brain to wake up is making learning process less efficient. Hopefully 301 won't be scheduled like this.

The lecture is extremely helpful but gets rushed at the end. It seems as though I have good clarity on the concepts during the first two hours (because plenty of time is taken to ensure the room is satisfied) and then I leave with many questions after we run short of time for the content in the last 30 minutes (and are given the assignment scope in 2 minutes).

My only concern is not being able to keep up with the course. It is very fast paced and I feel I am further behind than others in the course, a lot of whom came in with much more previous experience.
