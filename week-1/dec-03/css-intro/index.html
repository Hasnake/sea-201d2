    <h3>Developer | Educator</h3>

    <p>I am a software developer and veteran business professional with a record of success in learning new skills and utilizing my previous experience to accelerate positive results. I bring positive energy to any team, and enjoy tackling hard projects.</p>
    <p>While I'm away from the desk I can be found working around the house, or off camping and/or hiking in some remote area! I'm an active camper, hiker, and general outdoor-lover.</p>
    <p>I'm currently working my way through two top 100 lists of books, one in Sci-Fi and one in Fantasy, and typically have a general business book in-hand for those times when I need a dose of reality. In short, I simply enjoy quiet time with my family be it indoors or out when I'm not running full steam at work!</p>
